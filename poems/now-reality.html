        <p>They say people come and go<br>
        You came at the most random time<br>
        But you still found a way to make it yours <br>
        The time you came<br>
        Everything stopped<br>
        And it was just the two of us<br>
        I may never find the words beautiful enough<br>
        To describe the time in my life you altered<br>
        I may need to hace a late night conversation with the moon and aligned that day<br>
        But there is so much space between us <br>
        So much holding us back<br>
        I wish we could live in a fantasy where i dont have to leave things to my imagination<br>
        Or we could be in a fantasy where I would be the artist and you would be the art <br>
        In a world where you are a painter and i am your muse<br>
        Till we can create fantasies into realities<br>
        I will hold on to your eyes, your smile,<br>
        Laugh, your smell your touch.<br>
        That is my NOW REALITY<br>
        And I'm not letting it go. <br>
