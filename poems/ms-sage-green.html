        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: lighter;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Dear MS sage green</span> <br> 
          Brown eyes<br>
          Almond shaped<br>
          You had your lashes done<br>
          Dark brown skin<br>
          Your skin smooth like milk<br>
          I think about what your name is <br>
          You had your hair done in goddess braids that made you look like you were made for that role<br> 
          The perfectly placed dress on your body<br> 
          The sage green highlighting your beautifual dark skin and teh whole dress carving out the shape of your body <br>
          You didnt have to do much for me to stare <br>
          I had zero shame staring at you because i felt i was worthy of it<br>
          You looked at me and looked away<br>
          you saw me staring and smiled<br>
          I wish i said something<br>
          Still regretting why I left without saying anything<br>
          That smile wokr something in me I thought had died<br>
          I hope I see you again<br>
          Ms. Sage Green<br>
