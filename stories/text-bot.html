                <p>How would I tell the world I lost you? How do I tell myself to move on?</p>
                <br>
                <p>How would I live without you, Eniola? Come back to me, please come back to me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You went out with your friends the night before, but we spoke all night. You wanted to spend time with me because the time we spent apart has been getting to us. Me especially.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our conversation that night keeps playing in my head. I can't get it out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You told me about your day, about how much you missed me, about how much you couldn't wait to see me again. You told me about your plans for us, about how you wanted us to grow old together, about how you wanted us to have a family together.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But now, all I have is this text box. This empty text box that I can't fill with your messages anymore. This text box that used to light up my day with your words, your love, your presence.</p>
                <br>
                <p>How do I move on from this? How do I stop looking at this text box, hoping to see your name pop up? How do I stop waiting for messages that will never come?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: my stomach hurts. I feel like throwing up. I had puff puff from that outplace today, and it tasted off. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nana: OMG, I’m sorry, my love. Those people have been falling behind. o the last time we bought from them, it was also tasting off. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: that’s what I said. I called them and complained, and they said it was probably a bad batch. Hopefully, it will calm down</p>
                <p>Nana: have you left the house now? </p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: I’m still home. We are trying to book a ride. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nana: ok, babe, let me know how it goes, okay? I’m going to work on the proposal tomorrow. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: Can you remember Rick? He has a girlfriend now and that’s all he talks about. Like Sharon did this, Sharon did that. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nana: you talk about your girlfriend too. Disturb them. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: I, my Nana, everyone, every day, my Nana is calling me. I need to talk to my Nana. My Nana just texted me. I miss my Nana. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nana: As you should. I am happy to be your babe.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: I’m happy you’re my babe too. I’m blushing like mad. I’m sure everyone is looking at me funny. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nana: I’m also smiling, so hard! </p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: that’s why I’m here to make you smile and happy. I hope I’m making you happy though. Give me a report as my supervisor. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nana: Yes you are making me happy and I am happy were we are. You have an A++ </p>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: I’ll also give you an A+++. I’m giddy on the inside</p>
                <br>
                Nana: How is your party, How is it going?<br>
                <br>
                <p>Eniola: it’s just empty. I wish I didn’t come and Mel just picked up her bags and left. The babe is somehow. <br>
                    <br>
                Nana: you’ve said so. What happened? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: she said her Boyfriend called her to his apartment that was nearby. It was not her intention to leave us, which is a lie, by the way. She knew he was going to be home. She just used the pool party as a disguise because we told her she had been distant. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: ooh, I see, so it’s a pattern. Just leave her, and she’ll come around. Are you going now? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: not yet. We might go to the club after. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: babe, I don’t think I like this new job. There is a way that they look at me that needs to change. They make me feel so small that I cannot handle big tasks. And maybe the way I got the job is a problem for them? Or should I speak to my uncle about it? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: Nana, you have worked there for just one week. They probably need to adjust to you as new staff. Do you get what I'm saying? If it persists, talk to your uncle. But in the meantime, finish the memo and go to bed. You have a big Monday tomorrow <br>
                <br>
                Nana: okay. Thank you. But now I'm hungry. I had pasta a few hours ago I don’t get why I am hungry now <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: what are you going to eat? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I don’t know <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: what are your options? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: Silver and Gold I have none. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: LMAO, you should get something to eat <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I will, I will. Are you going to the club now? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: no we are still there. We might go home. I’m a little tired but it's fun here now <br>
                <br>
                Nana: that’s calm. As far as you are enjoying yourself. That’s what matters. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: Yeah. What are you doing right now? Still working on the proposal? Or are you going to bed soon? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I'm done with the proposal. I miss you. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: By the way, I sent the proposal to your mail for you to proofread; thank you. Love you. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: why are you missing me? I am here.<br>
                <br>
                Nana: I know. But in my bed, you are not. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: you want me in your bed so bad. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: what can I say? My bed has missed you. It's only fitting.<br>
                <br>
                Eniola: you don’t need to convince me that much. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: you also want me so BAD. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I do! And I miss doing things to you. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: oh, like what? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I miss kissing you. I miss my hands on your body; I miss you being in my arms. Everything, I miss everything I do when I’m with you. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: You're making me miss you more, huh? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I'm sorry. But I can't help it, I miss you <br>
                <br>
                Nana: it's okay, babe. I'll see you on Thursday. It's just four days. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: are you home now? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: yes. I just got home, and I’m so tired. I had fun <br>
                <br>
                Nana: that’s nice, my love. I’m happy it was not an L <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: yes, it wasn’t. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: Are you going to bed now? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: No I’m not sleepy yet. Are you? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: if you’re up I’m up with you <br>
                <br>
                Nana: You have been making me feel so special lately. I like it. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I told you that’s what I'm here for, plus I'm not misbehaving <br> 
                <br>
                Nana: what do you mean you are not misbehaving?  <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I tend to be selfish when I'm going through stuff. I have taken note of it, and I guess I’m changing <br>
                <br>
                Nana: that’s good, Eni. And know that I am here for you. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I know, babe, and that is one of the many reasons why I love you. You know, it’s just challenging to talk about something, but I’m getting there, hopefully. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: it’s a process. Take your time. I am not running away, and if you try to leave me, I will hunt you down. Just so you know <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: is this a threat? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: ah, tor. I don’t know o. take it how you want. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: okay o <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I am just kidding but know I am here for you always and forever. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: always and forever. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: my phone is about to die. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: don’t you guys have light? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: there is light; I can’t find my charger. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: You're always looking for something, Eni. If your phone dies on me, I am going to cry. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I have gotten a charger. I’m using Ricks.<br>
                <br>
                Nana: better <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: shouldn’t you be sleeping by now? Don’t you have a big presentation in the morning?<br>
                <br>
                Nana: I do. Have you read through my proposal? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I will do that now, ma'am. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: okay. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: oya maybe you should force yourself to sleep? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: NOOO, I want to talk to you. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: Nana, please go to bed<br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I will be here tomorrow <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: and the day after tomorrow and the day after the day after tomorrow <br>
                <br>
                Nana: so you want me to leave you and go to bed? <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I would never want you to leave me. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I know, baby. I know. <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: so please go to bed.<br> 
                <br>
                Eniola: good night, my love <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: I love you always and forever. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: okay. GOOD NIGHT, MY LOVE 
                <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I love you too. Always and forever. Dream of me <br>
                <br>
                Eniola: As usual. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I will talk to you tomorrow.<br>
                <br>
                    
                Nana: Good morning, babe. I'm leaving for work. When you wake up, text me, okay? <br>
                <br>
                Nana: how are you still sleeping at 10:30? Wake up! I’m about to go for my presentation. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: my presentation was so good. I am so thrilled. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: Eni, it's 12:50. If you are still sleeping by this time, you don’t love me. But you’re never sleeping at this time. Eni text me back. It’s driving me crazy <br>
                <br>
                Nana: so you have decided not to text me back or pick up my calls? Babe, did I do something wrong? Or are you having one of those episodes where you don’t want to talk to anyone? Eni, please speak to me. Just tell me what's going on even if you don’t want to tell me what is going on. Text me back so I know you are okay.<br> 
                <br>
                Nana: I called Rick, and he also didn’t pick up. I don’t have Mel’s number, but I have her Instagram. But you said she’s a somehow babe. I’m going to text her sha.<br>
                <br>
                Nana: ENIIII!! ENI, WAKE UP RIGHT NOW! MEL TOLD ME SOMETHING AND I CAN’T BELIEVE IT! <br>
                <br>
                Nana: WAKE UP NOW!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DIED IN YOUR SLEEP? Eni, you told me you were going to be here tomorrow, the next day after tomorrow, and the day after that. Eni, YOU SAID YOU WOULD LOVE ALWAYS AND FOREVER. <br>
                <br>
                Nana: I'm driving there if you don’t text me back now. The 4 hours all by myself <br>
                <br>
                Nana: your mother just called me. ENIOLA TOKUMBO. YOU LEFT ME? YOU LEFT ME ALL ALONE. ENIOLA ENIOLA. Please, please come back to me. Eniola, please come back to me. What about your plans for Thursday?.<br>
                <br>
                Nana:
