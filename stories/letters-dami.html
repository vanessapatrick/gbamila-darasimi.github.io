                <p>I am and I will always be in wonder of what happened that day. Did I fall in love with you in one day? Is that even possible? Or was I dreaming? </p>
                <p>On Saturday 6th July 2019, I woke up in anticipation of the wedding I was attending that day, my best friend’s sister was getting married, and it was going to be the event of the year. The weather was beautiful, the sun was out and about and the cool breeze coming in from my hotel windows just assured me that the day would be good. I left my room to the next room in search of my best friend and her boyfriend to join them for breakfast and final preparations for the wedding.</p>

                <p> I wasn’t a participant in the wedding in the sense that I was just a guest, and I did not have to do any work, I was just there to enjoy my time and have as much fun as I could because I was traveling back the next day. I got dressed, I got fitted into a green floral body con dress with a little hint of pink and black as highlights. It was a slip dress so I took a black scarf to cover my shoulders.</p>

                <p>On the car ride to the event center, I made up my mind I wasn’t going to make bad decisions, keep the most composure and avoid alcohol because of previous events. Then I saw you and all the decisions I had made twenty-five minutes before that slipped away; faded away like they never existed. We locked eyes and we left them there, I felt your eyes roll down my body which was perfectly outlined by the dress that was placed beautifully on my body, and then back up again and you looked away. </p>

                <p>The event was about to begin, and I had to look for my spot on the table. You had been sitting on a table labeled ‘friends’. As I walked over to that table, you stood up and walked to the bar. I saw my name at the table but a few seats away from you. I don’t think I mentioned it but I switched up the names so I could stay beside you. The reason I was anxious was unknown to me- you came back to the table with 2 drinks in your hand and slid one of them across the table and it landed in front of me. I looked up and smiled and couldn’t help but stare at you while you sat down. I didn’t care if it made you uncomfortable, I never wanted to take my eyes off you. </p>

                <p>“I will run away if you keep staring at me like that o” was the first thing you said to me, realizing I had been staring. I smiled and looked away, I took a sip of the drink you brought for me before realizing I didn’t say thank you, but by the time I looked back up you were taken up by your phone and I thought it would be rude if I distracted you from what you were doing because it looked important, but I did it anyway, I tapped your very firm arms and thanked you for the drink then  used that opportunity to introduce myself, “AISHA, AISAH AISHA!” you kept on repeating my name like you knew me from somewhere or you had heard about me from someone- but the way my name fell out of your mouth made me nervous . You told me your name is “DAMILARE’ But your friends call you “Dami”, I didn’t know if I was in the position to call you Dami because we had just met but your name was a little difficult for me to pronounce due to my very prominent Hausa intonation so I stuck to Dami. </p>

                <p>We spoke about work, I told you I was the publicity personnel for an advertising firm in Kaduna, and you were so interested in what I did- I explained my work requirements and what I did on a daily and you just stared at me talking. We spoke about our interests, you said you enjoyed traveling and you had been to 12 countries and you plan on visiting more, you enjoyed reading but just African literature because you loved the way the authors made Nigeria so authentic – you spoke so sophisticated about these books, some I had read and some I had not but I could tell it was something you loved doing. We talked to each other like we had known each other for decades. It was just perfect. </p>

                <p>We had forgotten we were at an event and kept our conversation going, it had gotten to the deep parts of my life when you asked me about my love life and I was not reluctant to spill the tea on what I have been through with Nigerian men. We moved from where everyone was by the tables to the bar to get more drinks, but we decided to remain by the bar instead of going back to the table “Believe it or not I have had the worst dates in the history of dates in this world” you started laughing as I finished my statement, laughing in a way that seemed like what I said was not possible and I was kind of offended because I know what I have faced with Nigerian men “okay let’s play a game, you’ll tell me a bad date experience and if it’s worse than mine I’ll drink, if I can counter your story with mine you will have to drink. Is that fine?” I nodded my head in agreement because I already had a straw in my mouth. I knew I was going to win so I let you go first. </p>

                <p>“I HAD just moved to Abuja from Port Harcourt, and I was excited to be here because I had been to Abuja a few times and it was a blast. Some of my friends from school stayed in Abuja at that time and when they heard I was moving there, they were more excited than I was - they kept saying it was time for me to meet new people because I had not been in a relationship since university. A friend of mine said he was going to introduce me to a colleague of his from work, I got her number and we started texting and I decided to take her to eat burgers because she said she had not had a good burger in Abuja. We went to a place called the pepper grill in Wuse because I had heard good things about it. We got there and placed our orders- she ordered for a double deck cheeseburger with large fries, and I ordered a regular chicken sandwich with onion rings. We had a good conversation while we waited for the food to arrive, and everything was going well. The food came and the date went sideways. Tell me why, she devoured this food like she had not eaten at home, no form of decency or home training. I looked up so shocked, words couldn’t come out of my mind. Believe it or not that was not the worst part, the worst part was I could hear and see the food mix in her mouth, she was smacking her mouth while eating, I was disgusting, and I didn’t know If I wanted to tell her to close her mouth or just leave her and never text her again. It was very awkward from then and I never texted her after that” the way the movement of your body matched the story you just finished telling made it funnier to me and I didn’t stop laughing plus the fact that the previous drinks I had were coming into lime lights, I could not help the tears from coming out of my eyes attempting to ruin my makeup. “Your story is not as bad for real” I said taking a sip of my drink preparing myself for my story. “As a girl with really traditional parents, my mother always got my sisters, and I set up with one Hadiya’s son from her book club or the women from her fellowship. My sisters got the good dates, My first sister got married to one of the men my mum had set her up with and that alone boosted her confidence and she felt she could be the matchmaker of the century but when it came to setting me up? She failed terribly. One day My mum I go mini golfing and she had set me up with her friends son who just came back from Germany he looked pretty decent, it looked like he just got his hair done and he dressed to impress and I did not totally oppose this particular guy because you know I want me some foreign man but I knew it was too good to be true. We start talking and we hit it off so I thought. Only for this guy to walk up to me and grabbed my ass.  When I looked up at him screaming that he should get his filthy fingers off my ass, he screamed back at me and told me I had been hinting my ass at him all day and I wondered how. I then realized that we had been playing golf and I had been bending over. i didn’t know what selection of my emotions I wanted to surface if It was anger or disgust.” I paused and took a sip of my drink before laughing. The blank expression on your face confirmed that I had won this game. It looked like you didn’t know what to say and I found it funny. You took the shot and apologized for the whole of mankind and promised that you wouldn’t do that to me and we giggled about the fact that you were already thing about the future with me when we had just met. </p>

                <p>We ordered more drinks and kept the conversations going, your hand made a few appearances on my lap as we laughed and conversed, I wanted it to stay there but you kept on taking them off. The DJ had called everyone’s attention the stage, announcing it was time for the couple to have their first dance and after a few minutes others who were willing to dance could join them on the dance floor. We both watched as the couple swayed their bodies in similar motion you would think they were in sync. You stretched your hand to me asking if I wanted to dance, I would have been a fool if I rejected that offer. I put my hand in yours and our hands intertwined, at that point everything felt right, it felt like the world had stopped and it was just the both of us left on the plant. We got to the dance floor and you put your hands on my waist, staring at me like you were waiting for my approval and I nodded- my hands crossed behind your neck making me very close to you, feeling how firm your body was, the wave of the floral perfume you had on hit me and it amused me, because I know that men do not like floral scents, from what I know though. </p>

                <p>The song had finally come to an end and we did not want to let go of each other but we had to. Finally going back to me seat I realized I had not been with my phone all day because I had been taken up by your company. I got my phone and saw a million messages from Ehi (my best friend) asking me where I was and saying she has an incident with her boyfriend and I panicked, I didn’t realized I had started running towards the door of the event center trying to look for Ehi, I panicked and I didn’t realize I had left you back at the table. </p>

                <p>I finally found Ehi by the parking lot sitting on the ground with her face in her hands, she sensed someone coming and she looked up, she looked like she was about to cry. I joined her on the ground and put my arms around her and stayed silent. She told me, she broke up with the boyfriend because seeing her sister get married and so in love, she realized that she in fact didn’t love him and she did not want to waste any more time so she had to end things with him, he did not take it well obviously but it was what was best for them. We sat there for a while before I tell her about you, I explained all that had happened that day and how I felt about you and how the time I spent with you made me feel, she listened to me and smiled with me, we were both excited that I had finally found someone I wanted to get to know and maybe more. </p>

                <p>She finally decided we go inside and get something to eat and I could show her my mystery man. We get into the event center and I scanned for you from where I was standing and you were not seated at the table, I looked over at the bar and seats were empty. I walk to the table where we sat and checked around and you were not in sight, I looked around in search of your body structure and I did not find you. I went to the bar and asked the bartender if he had seen you, I asked him if he saw the man I had been with at the bar for hours and he told  me I had not been to the bar all day. He made that statement and I was startled and in disbelief, I laughed at the joke because I believed it was funny. I went back to the table to ask if they knew where you went to and the girl beside me told me that she had not seen anyone that matches your description here this night and that I had been sitting alone all night. I looked at her dead in the eye and laughed. She was either blind or I was running mad! I walked around asking people if they saw someone that fit your description and they all said they saw no one. I ran to the parking lot to look for you but it was empty, I started checking inside cars for you but it was to no avail, I sat by a random car wondering; “Have I gone mad? Did I conjure you up in my mind? Were you real? Did I have too much to drink?” I was still in disbelief  because I know what I felt and what I felt was real and I didn’t want to believe I was lonely to the point where I imagined someone. I texted Ehi asking her to bring the sitting arrangements for the wedding because she had access to it, we looked for your name ‘DAMI’ ‘DAMILARE’ and the only Dami on the guest list was a bridesmaid. At that point, I lost my mind. “Did I make someone up? Am I going mad? Was I hallucinating?”, I stood there lost for words, staring at Ehi who looked concerned  for me and kept asking if I was okay.. </p>

                <p>I decided to go back to the hotel to get myself together and pack for my trip back home the next day. I called an Uber and it took me back to the hotel. With my bag in my hand and my scarf in the other, I dragged myself through the lobby of the hotel and made my way to the elevator, as I walked into the elevator I saw you. I know I saw you, walking out of the hotel. When I realized who it was it was too late the elevator door had closed and was about to move. I kept on pushing the button for the doors to open and by the time it opened up you had gone. I ran outside looking around to see if you had not gotten far but the streets were empty.  The thought of insanity hit me and chills ran down my spine, I did not believe I was insane- it was an absurd thought. </p>

                <p>I went up to my room and called the hotel manager asking if he could let me look through the hotel cameras to search for you. We waited as the recorded footage played back to when I walked into the building. We watched it back till the part I ran out of the elevator to the doorway to look for you but we saw no one go in or come out except me.</p>

                <p> Aisha closed her journal. She was done writing for the day, her therapist demanded that she wrote about that day to detach herself from the events that happened. She vigorously shook her head trying to get rid of the flashing hot images that ran through her mind from that day. </p>

                <p>It had been 10 months since Aisha met Dami, and 7 months of active therapy sessions because she began to lose her mind. 10 months since Aisha met Dami, there was still a void to fill. </p>
