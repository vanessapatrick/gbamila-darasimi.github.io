                <p id="letter-left">The universe,<br>The world,<br>Africa,<br> Nigeria.
                    </p>
                <p>DEAR WORLD,</p>
                <p>I hope this letter does not meet you well, I am writing this letter to you to let you know you have failed me and I want you to know how and take all the blame for what happened and will happen to me. </p>

                <p>After closing hours on Friday, I was on my way home from work, i took a cab from work to the pedestrian bridge, holding my laptop to my chest as I walked up the bridge and contemplating on what to eat that night. I saw a woman selling groundnut on the bridge and thought of buying that for dinner since I was not that hungry, while I was standing by the woman I sighted another woman selling Moin Moin and Agidi by the edge of the bridge and decided to get that instead. </p>

                <p>I was almost at the end of the stairs when I saw her walk towards a cab and I stopped, I paused in awe of what I saw, I wasn’t scared or embarrassed as I stared at her. she probably looked like every other well created human on the planet but what stood out to me was she looked peaceful, her jaws were unclenched, shoulders relaxed and her face was calm, beautiful and calm, flawless and calm. I stood there for 2 minutes before getting myself back but she got into the cab before I could approach her. She saw me, looked at me through the Window of the cab and smiled. That smile fixed every broken thing in my body. </p>

                <p>It took me a while for me to understand what happened that day. I got home dropped my food in the kitchen took out my journal and wrote down everything that happened at the pedestrian bridge.</p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Brown eyes<br>
                    Almond shaped<br>
                    You had your lashes done <br>
                    Dark brown skin <br>
                    Your skin was as smooth as milk <br>
                    You had your hair done in goddess braids that made you look like you were made for that role <br>
                    The perfectly placed dress on your body <br>
                    The sage green highlighting your beautiful dark skin and whole dress carving out the shape of your body <br>
                    You didn’t have to do much for me to stare <br>
                    I had zero shame staring at you because I felt I was worthy of it<br> 
                    You looked at me and looked away <br>
                    You saw me staring and smiled <br>
                    Still regretting why I let you leave without saying anything <br>
                    I wish I said something <br>
                    That smile woke something in me I thought had died <br>
                    I hope I see you again <br>
                    Ms. Sage green.<br>

                </p>

                <p>Every day after that, I waited by the bridge after work hoping and praying I would see her again, but I never did. I stayed by the other end of the bridge waiting, every day for 2 weeks constantly waiting. The groundnut woman at the bridge knew me and always engaged me with conversations while I waited for her but she never showed up. Everyone thought I was crazy, that I didn’t see anyone that day, my best friend told me to forget about it. I would never see her again but she was always on my mind, constantly on my mind. </p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Dear MS sage green<br> 
                    I know we haven’t spoken <br>
                    We stared at but didn’t talk<br>
                    But I think of you often <br>
                    I think about what I would do if I see you again <br>
                    What I would say when I finally talk to you <br>
                    I think about what your name is <br>
                    I think about what your likes and dislikes are <br>
                    I think about how I want to look into your eyes till I know you are what I’m missing <br>
                    Dear MS sage green <br>
                    I hope I see you again <br>

                    <p>2 months after the incident at the bridge, I saw her again. </p>

                    <p>I was at DASH for my company end of the year lunch. While we were waiting for the food to arrive, a group of protesters invaded in front of the restaurant chanting and singing songs against the Nigerian Government. The Nigerian labor force had refused to increase the minimum wage even though the situation of the country was deteriorating on daily basis. I saw her standing there in a brown and green floral dress, her hair tied up in a head wrap and they beads on her neck highlighting her neck line but also giving her jaw line the space to shine. She looked stunning. I knew I had to take this opportunity that was served to me by the universe on a platter of Gold. I could not let it waste. </p>

                    <p>She was getting off the phone as I approached her, she turned to me and I could see the shock in her face like she had seen a ghost “Hi, so I’m guessing the stars have finally aligned” I said as she looked up at me, turning fully highlighting her whole face and she smiled “I always knew I would see you again” I was in awe of how she could remember me. The plan was to introduce myself but she surprisingly remembered who I was. I offered to buy her lunch to get to know her better but she said no, she told me the only way I could get to know her was If I joined their protest and I was not about to forfeit this opportunity I had to fix a missing puzzle, so I took her up on her offer. I went back into the restaurant and told the head of my department I had something really important to attend to and I was going to try to make it back before it was time to share the gifts but I dropped the gift with my office best friend just in case I was not able to make it back on time.</p>

                    <p>We met up every day for 4 days after that and I within that period I found out so much about her, it felt like I have known her for years. She only has 2 names technically, English and Itsekiri, she is a cat lover, she has 2(Birdy and Lady) and also a plant mum, I found out she is a writer as well, an artist who draws, paints and sculpts, she is a gold girl and not a silver girl, she is a big reader, she enjoys music, she listens to A lot of Lauryn hill, Sade and Asa she says they are like serotonin to her. She does not know how to dance but she tries A LOT, she enjoys cooking and she moves side to side when she likes what she is eating, she unknowingly taps her spoon twice on the plate before every bit she takes,  she believes everything that happens to her is a product of a manifestation somewhere which will always be funny to me, she loves tattoos, she has just one on her lower back  but she loves tattoos on other people, the likes warm colors but she never wears them she is obsessed with green, and she always said that is the reason why she loves Nigeria, her love for the country is so great I have never met anyone like her, she speaks 4 Nigerian languages(the three major languages and Itsekiri),  the authenticity of her mind amuses me till this day and I don’t think there can be some else out there like her. Those five days were amazing. </p>

                    <p>I travelled to Bayelsa for work to cover the story on the wild spread of polio at a particular village at Yenagoa. The work trip was for a week and some days and for that period I had zero contact with her, the village I was staying at was very underdeveloped, no electricity, no call or internet service, I had to walk almost 2 miles to get my phone and laptop charged and struggle for the internet connection to get my flight details back home. The day I got back to my house, all I wanted to do is see her and sleep with her warm embrace but I thought to myself that we had not gotten there yet so I didn’t call her. I started getting settled when she called me and asked if I was home and once I answered I heard the doorbell ring and there she was in her pajamas by 4pm with a small bag and another containing food. I was so confused by what was happening but there was no way I was going to tell her to leave. She said hi , walked into the house, dropped the bags on the kitchen counter walked over to me who was still standing by the front door and she hugged me and pecked me on the lips. I could see it on her face she didn’t know how I felt about what she just did and what it meant so I pulled her back for a hug and her hugged her so tight I felt her muscles relax then I kissed her, just to let her know how I felt and assure her she was not wrong. We spent the rest of the day watching game of thrones and the watching cat videos that popped up on her Instagram.</p>

                    <p>We spent Christmas together but she had to go home for the New Year, which was the longest we had been away from each other since my trip to Bayelsa but I had fun taking care of her cats while we waited for her. During her stay there, we texted and called every day. She introduced me to her dad and her little cousins, sent me pictures and videos updating me on everything happening at the village.it felt like I was there with her. </p>

                    <p>I always knew I wanted her to be mine from the first day I saw her at that bridge, and I planned towards it. When she got back, I planned to take her to a poetry event my company was holding and after that we went to a book store which also sells vinyl and we got each other a book and I got her the miseducation of Lauryn Hill vinyl and end the day by asking her to be my girlfriend. The day for the event came and everything was perfect. I wrote her a poem while we were at the event and gave it to her at the end of the day before asking her to be my girlfriend and </p>

                        To a place where no one knows our names <br>
                        To a place where I could hold your heart <br>
                        And cradle it like its mine <br>
                        My arms may start aching but it won’t cost me a dime <br>

                        To a place where I am perfectly settled in your arms and all my pain drains away <br>
                        Let’s go to a place where I am who I am and you are who you are <br>
                        To a place where we are not intruders in our own minds<br>

                        Let’s run away together <br>
                        To a place where no one knows who we are<br>
                        Where no one knows our names <br>
                        To a place where it would just be us<br>

                        </p>
                        <p>Covid came and we spent 6 months together. We were both working from home so we did everything together. We stayed at my house because it was closest to the town and it was slightly bigger and could accommodate the two of us and her cats. We got to understand each other better within that period and talked everything out, we never went to bed angry with each other even though we barely had arguments. </p>
                        <p>One Sunday morning, she was finishing up a painting at the courtyard when I heard her scream on the phone. i rushed out of the kitchen to the courtyard and I saw her on the ground covered in paint and her eyes filled with tears-I asked her what the problem was and she looked me in the eye trying to speak but nothing came out of her mouth. I sat down beside her and pulled her close to me. We sat there for an hour or more and she didn’t utter a word. Her phone kept ringing and she didn’t flinch. After some time she looked at me and said “they took him” she stood up and she packed up her things into the house. I followed her asking who they took because I had no idea who she was talking about. She had stopped crying and she went to the bathroom to shower, I followed her because I didn’t think she should have been left alone. I sat down waiting for her to get out of the shower when she told me what happened. There was an election going on in her village and the two major parties had an altercation which proceeded into physical fight and they ended up burning down the polling unit, leaving 4 dead and 26 injured, and unfortunately her dad was at the polling unit. </p>

                        <p>We left for Delta 2 weeks after she got that call to prepare for the burial. Her mum was never in the picture, she left to remarry after her daughter was born saying she could not handle a child at that moment. As the only child she had to take care of everything. The day of the burial came and she did not want get out of bed, she held me so tight I could feel her pain through her chest, she couldn’t say good bye to her best friend, the only person that always supported her and stood by her. She had not cried since the first time she got that call but she cried that day, i stood by her from the beginning of the day till the end. When she was called to give a tribute to her dad, she did not want to let me go, so I went up with her. </p>
                        <p>4 days after the burial we headed back home, and throughout the journey she did not talk to me, even after many attempts of engaging her in conversations, cat videos or funny tiktoks I found, her only reaction was a smile. The first time she spoke to me was when we got home “will you take me to my house? I need to get some things for work tomorrow” she said. I did not think she would want to go back to work just yet but she said she was ready for it. We got to her apartment and got the things she needed, we got Lady and Birdy from her neighbor and we stopped at the African cultural center to get clay and we got food from a restaurant beside the cultural center. On our way back home, she touched my hand and told me to stop, I pulled over and she told me she wanted to meet the Governor “he cannot win that election without knowing my father’s life was sacrificed, he has to know what he did, he has to know what happened” the tears rolled down her face and they didn’t stop. I knew I had to do right by her because she had to grief in her own way.</p>

                        <p>That visit to the Governor change Mary-Jane, I saw her walk out of the office with zero to no strength in her body, she was weak and she could barely stand, she was in a pool of tears and I knew something went badly wrong. No one would listen to her at the office, telling her she needed to make an appointment and she needed a good and valid reason to see the Governor and she was devastated that they didn’t think the death of her father was a valid reason to see the man that killed him.  After that day, she stopped doing everything she loved, she stopped cooking. Painting, writing, sculpting, she barely ate once a day, she stopped sleeping, stopped going to work and most of all she stopped talking. She stopped talking to everyone including me, it was so sad to see someone I loved in that state, I couldn’t bare it. I gave her space and time to grief because grief takes time.</p>
                        
                        <p>2 weeks turned into 4 weeks </p>

                        <p>4 weeks turned into 2 months </p>

                        <p>2 months turned into 3 months </p>

                        <p>Our relationship was not the same, it felt like a part of her had died with her father that day, this was not the Mary Jane I fell in love with, this was not the person I met that day on the bridge, she was not the same person and it began to affect me. I began to lose myself in thoughts and constant worry but I still decided to give her time, I thought that in time she would come back to me. I never got my Mary-Jane back, she was swallowed up by the grief she did not have space for anything or anyone and that included me, even though she remained me constantly, every day that she loved me, but was the love enough? Is love ever enough? </p>

                        <p>For the fifth month remembrance of her father’s death, she wanted to go to Warri, to spend time there and to get the closure she needed. On the day before I trip, I got back from work and there was no one at home, she had cleaned the house and cleaned out her things also, I called her number multiple times, nothing. I called her apartment line and nothing. I was scared. I started looking for the car keys to drive to her apartment. I got to her apartment and it was locked, I asked her neighbor if she had seen her and she said yes but she didn’t tell her where she was going, but she told her to Lady to me if I came to ask after her.  I took Lady and went back home. I called her a couple more times and I got nothing, I sent multiple messages, emails but no reply. I didn’t want to lose her. I was devastated.  </p>

                        <p>One day I was going through my mails and I got a mail from and art gallery opening we had booked for months ago and the opening was that night. I needed a change of scenery that day so I decided to go. The art gallery was just a few minutes away from my house so I made it on time. I walked around looking at the beautiful art pieces and making the same comments Mary-Jane would make every time we went to the art gallery. I see a cluster at the very end of the gallery and went to check it out and I froze. It was the painting my Mary-Jane was working on when she got the call about her father. It was there, how she left it that day-unfinished and glorious. Below the painting it said “THE POINT OF GIREF ‘I love you zogie’ ” she knew I was going to be there. </p>

                        <p>She left me, a piece of the puzzle has gone missing again and I don’t know where to find it in this big wicked world. I have tried to move on, but nothing works, I tried therapy, I took a break from work to get myself back in one piece but nothing worked. I loved her. I love her and I always will. </p>

                        <p>Dear world, Bring Mary-Jane Oritsetimeyin Charles to me. Please</p>

                        <p style="float: right;">Yours faithfully, <br>Ehizogie Afolabi.</p>
