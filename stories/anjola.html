              <p>This was your last day in Abuja, and you were at the club with your friends. I got dragged to the club that day to celebrate a friend’s birthday. I hated the club, So I sat down by the edge of the bar while my friends danced till their feet were numb. I see you by the restroom door from where i was, but it was just a glimpse and I looked away. I left the club wondering who you were because I Knew you were not from around here. You had been on my mind from day to day, but I was too scared to ask anyone at the club about you.</p>

              <p>Months went by and I could not take you out of my mind, you stood out to me that day and ever since you had a permanent space in my head. I eventually came to the realization that I was only driving myself mad by not asking around about you. I asked a friend I saw you talk to at the club. A lawyer, you just made partner in your father’s firm, and you came to Abuja to celebrate with your law school friends and you are not the type to talk to new people.</p>

              <p>I see your text notification pop up on my phone, not knowing who it was but I replied immediately saying to myself I don’t like keeping people waiting but I was just excited to talk to someone new. You always told me finding my Instagram wasn’t a problem but texting was, it had you pacing around your office for hours thinking of what to say and how to act if I didn’t reply. Your first text was a joke which made me laugh for a while and I knew we were off to a good start.</p>

              <p>We text back and forth for days, and I still didn’t know who you were, you had a nice time being anonymous, but I really wanted to know who you were. We decided to face time and at that point, I knew I felt something for you even though I did not know what I felt exactly but I knew I felt something towards you. Days turns into weeks, and you decided to reveal yourself to me, you called me on a Thursday. I recognized you but I could not just place the face or where I saw you. The calls became frequent, the feelings became stronger.</p>

              <p>You posted a video from the night at the club and I could not believe it. How did I not know who you were? I stared at the video for a while reminiscing on that night because I never knew fate would ever be on my side. We talked about that day often. Our love story began to bloom, it was nothing like i have ever experienced in my life and I loved it.</p>

              <p>The long-distance was getting to us because I was always busy with work and you were always busy with work also, we would come back from work so tired, and we end up not talking to each other for days, But we always made time for each other, you would always tell me the drama going on at your office because you enjoy gossiping. On Fridays, you’d send lunch and a bouquet to my office, it became so frequent everyone at the office started talking but never to me. Fridays were your meeting days, so it was a lot for you to handle but you made it your priority to make me smile </p>

              <p>I got a text from you saying “I have a surprise for you. Call me when you see this.” I didn’t know what to expect but I was excited. I called you by exactly 12:15 am and you answered immediately holding up your flight ticket to Abuja. I couldn’t believe it. We had spoken a lot about you coming over or me coming to Lagos, but it never worked out because of our busy schedule, but it was finally happening you were coming to Abuja to see me even though it was not the primary aim of the visit, I would tell everyone it was.</p>

              <p>You were going to stay over at my house for a few days before going to the hotel assigned by the company. I decided to shake things up at my apartment. I went to the market to buy general groceries, stocked up the house, deep cleaned the house and gave the old sheets and my big bag of laundry to Solomon the dry cleaner. I was excited about your arrival.</p>

              <p>On the day you were to come to Abuja, you texted me in the morning saying how you couldn’t wait to see me and how you couldn’t stop yourself from imagining how life would be with me. My heart melted at the sight of that message, and it made me want you more. Your flight was scheduled for 3:45 pm but it was delayed to 4:15. I was angry at the airline because the Nigerian airline system is not getting any better, but you were so calm telling me “It’s okay as far as I get to see my baby”. You texted me while boarding your flight and we texted back and forth. But the last thing you sent to me before you turned off your phone was “I can’t wait to see you, my love”. I saw the notification while I was putting the catfish into the stew to boil. I couldn’t wait for you to taste my cooking.</p>

              <p>I stood at the airport waiting for your arrival. For the first 45 minutes, I was anxious as hell, but I eventually eased up and got myself together. It was an hour and thirty minutes. You should have landed by now. You should have called me. You should have texted me! But nothing. I asked the flight attendant who worked by the stands when the flight was getting here, and she couldn’t give me a straight answer she kept saying they are working on it. WORKING ON WHAT? I sat down by the waiting area waiting for my baby, but my baby never showed up. I decided to keep myself company with my phone while waiting for your text, but all I got was bad news.</p>

              <p>The news report said a pilot had lost control of an aircraft, flight AJB475, it sounded familiar, but I was praying it wasn’t it. I went back to our texts to check the details of your flight and the tears I had been holding back got loose, the news report said it crashed somewhere in Kaduna. You were so close to me! So damn close but you got lost in the transmission.</p>

              <p>I went home not knowing how to feel and act, I could barely take myself out of the car, still in shock and I had not fully grasped what had happened. I got a call from my mum telling me she saw the news and she asked if I was okay. How would I have been, okay? I was not okay, and I am not still okay.</p>
